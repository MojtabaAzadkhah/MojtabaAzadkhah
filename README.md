## 👋 About Me

I am a **Senior Python Developer** and **Backend Developer** specializing in **Django**.  
I have professional experience in designing and building scalable backend systems, APIs, and data-driven applications.

Currently, my main focus is on **deeply improving my skills in Data Engineering**.  
I am spending most of my time learning core concepts, exploring data architectures, designing data pipelines, and working on focused, real-world data engineering projects.

Over the next **4–5 months**, my public GitHub activity may be limited, as my priority is:
- Deep research and learning
- Designing solid data architectures
- Building personal, production-oriented data engineering projects

My goal is to reach a **highly advanced level in Data Engineering**, and I plan to publish the outcomes of this journey through well-structured projects in the future.
